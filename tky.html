    <p>Kylian Mbappé Lottin was born on 20 December 1998 in the 19th arrondissement of Paris and was raised in Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis, in the northeastern suburbs of Paris. His father, Wilfrid Mbappé, is a football coach and is originally from the Cameroonian island of Djébalè (fr), which is home to the Sawa people. His mother and agent, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian Kabyle origin and is a former handball player. He has a younger brother, Ethan, who plays for Lille. Their older adoptive brother, Jirès Kembo Ekoko, is a former professional footballer.
    <p>Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time.
    <p>With PSG, he won six Ligue 1 titles and four Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League final in 2020.
    <p>As a child, Mbappé went to a private Catholic school in Bondy, where he was considered academically gifted but unruly. At 15 he began taking Spanish lessons, and eventually became fluent in the language. Among Mbappé's idols growing up were Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, Ronaldo Nazario, Eden Hazard and Thierry Henry. As a child, Mbappé received Robinho's AC Milan shirt as a gift from his nanny's family, who were Italians and supporters of the club. However, his own favourite team had always been Real Madrid. In May 2024, just days before his transfer to Real Madrid was announced, Mbappé mentioned that he still follows Serie A and AC Milan, and would like to play for the Rossoneri if he is ever to move to Italy in the future.
    <p>Mbappé was coached by his father, Wilfried, when he started his career with AS Bondy. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,
    <p>The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).
    <p>Mbappé scored the first hat-trick of his first-team career on 14 December 2016, in a 7–0 home win over Rennes in the Coupe de la Ligue round of 16 – the first hat-trick scored by any Monaco player in the competition since Sonny Anderson in 1997 On 11 February 2017.
    <p>On 31 August 2017, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) announced the signing of Mbappé from Monaco on loan with a mandatory purchase option of €180 million. According to PSG's assistant sporting director Luis Ferrer, the shift in Mbappé's decision to join the club was partly thanks to a "convincing" speech given by manager Unai Emery at the Mbappés' home over the summer.The €180 million fee made Mbappé the most expensive teenager ever and the second-most-expensive player ever behind teammate Neymar, and broke the record for the largest transfer within a domestic league.
    <p> He was handed the number 29 shirt upon arrival in the French capital.
    <p>On 8 September 2017, Mbappé made his PSG debut in a 5–1 Ligue 1 win away at Metz, scoring a goal. Four days later, he recorded his first European goal for the club in a 5–0 UEFA Champions League group stage away defeat of Celtic. He starred in PSG's 3–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the second group game of the Champions League, setting up goals for Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the latter seeing him taking out a defender with a feint by rolling the ball under his foot. On 6 December, Mbappé scored his tenth career Champions League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich, becoming the youngest player to reach that mark, at the age of 18 years and 11 months. Having already won his first league title with the club, on 8 May 2018, Mbappé featured in PSG's 2–0 win over Les Herbiers in the Coupe de France final.
    <p>In July 2018, Mbappé was given the number 7 jersey for the upcoming season with PSG, taking up the squad number left vacant by Lucas Moura. Sporting the hashtag #K7LIAN, Mbappé stated, "I keep trying to progress on the pitch and I think that, for me, it was the right time to change number. It is something of an affirmation. The No. 7 shirt is a legendary one and many greats have worn it. I hope that I will be able to do this number justice on the pitch."
